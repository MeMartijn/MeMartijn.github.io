                                    <br />In this group assignment, our team thought about options that were appealing to the people that visit Science Park. A big part of the audience are students. Our solution was a screen with the departure times of the public transport on Science Park, because most students use public transport to get to and from Science Park. To make it interactive, we added a live Twitter feed.

                                    Using user personas and a customer journey, I mapped the possibilities and chances for a succesful product. The analysis provided me with ideas for three apps: an app that provides the user with tips for healthy meals, an app that gives advice for healthy activities according to the weather forecast, and an app that can help you get rid of an appetite for snacks.

                                Our team created a fairly simple design, with as the main purpose selling the book. We tried to accomplish that by placing a call-to-action in the center of the website.

                                    The main aim of this assignment was to get used to user testing and get some experience in planning and carrying out tests. For this particular test, we asked our subjects to examine the popular Dutch website NPO.nl. We also offered some solutions to the problems that we discovered.

                                    For this exercise, I used personas and job stories to create low-fidelity wireframes and eventually detailed high-fidelity wireframes. This exercise was aimed at creating a product from sketch, all the way to a finished product.

                                    For this week's exercise, we decided to redesign the current scheduling website of the faculty: DataNose. This website is absolutely horrible for mobile users. That's why we went on and designed a new mobile interface for Datanose. The results are, in my opinion, really well executed.

                                    This exercise was important for me, because it changed how I look at websites and apps. I analyzed the website of the NPO, and scanned it for all the social interactions. I also mentioned some improvements, and new social interactions.

For example, to decide between a chocolate flavoured filling or a vanilla flavoured filling, what type of user input would be the best?
