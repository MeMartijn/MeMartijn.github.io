                <p>Interaction design is a course at the University of Amsterdam. During four weeks, I designed a couple of small assignments. This page displays my personal progress. </p>

                            Case: <b>A building at Science Park has an empty wall. The management of the University of Amsterdam would like to have something interactive on the wall. Think about something that fits into the environment and that is appealing to the audience.</b>
                            <br />In this group assignment, our team thought about options that were appealing to the people that visit Science Park. A big part of the audience are students. Our solution was a screen with the departure times of the public transport on Science Park, because most students use public transport to get to and from Science Park. To make it interactive, we added a live Twitter feed.

                        I chose the popular app WhatsApp, that I use for daily communication with friends and family. I analyzed my use of the app using UML and wrote some user stories.
